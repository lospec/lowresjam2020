# Heroes Guild: Help Wanted

Heroes' Guild: Help Wanted is an pixel art RPG where you venture out into a big world, battling all kinds of enemies to bring back gold, treasure and weapons for your guild. Gear up by winning or purchasing new weapons and armor, and use them to defeat over 64 unique enemies, collect over 64 items, and choose from over 64 different characters! All this at a resolution of just 64x64 pixels!

The game has a lot of content, but as it was made quickly is still rather buggy. If it were refined a little it could still be a very fun game, so any help towards squashing bugs would be greatly appreciated!
